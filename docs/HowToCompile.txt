How to Compile
---------------

This guide describes a series of steps that you should follow to compile your
source code with JDK 1.8. 

1. Download the following:

	* JDK 8: http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/
	* JEdit: http://www.jedit.org/
	* Ant: http://ant.apache.org/

2. Make the folling directory structure:

	Sanbox
	|-----jdk8
	|-----ant
	|-----projects
	
	* Place the uncompressed JDK build in the jdk8 directory.
	* Place the uncompressed Apache Ant in the ant directory.
	* The project directory will be for JEdit projects.
	* If you already have Apache Ant installed, it is better if you make a copy
	of it,since this new Apache Ant needs to be reconfigured to work with JDK 8.

3. Install the following JEdit Plugins:

	* Ant Farm
	* Java Fold
	* Project Builder
	* Project Viewer
	* Project Wizard
	* SVN Plugin

4. Configure your Apache Ant:

	* Open the ant.bat file in a text editor.
	* At the top of the file define the JAVA_HOME variable and make it point to
	the directory where the JDK8 is installed. Somewhat like this:
	
	JAVA_HOME=C:\Sanbox\jdk8
	
5. Configure JEdit Ant Plugin
	
	* In JEdit go to Plugins -> Plugin Options -> Ant Farm -> Build Options
	* In the dialog select the option:
		"Run Ant targets using an external script/build file"
	* Choose your modified ant.bat script.
	

6. Create a new Java Project:

	* In JEdit go to Plugins -> Project Builder -> Create New Project
	* Choose Java Application and click Next
	* Choose your "projects" directoy as the place to locate files.
	
	Voila! At this point, JEdit will present four buttons in the tool bar:
	Build Application, Compile, Clean and Run Application.
	
	These are based on the build.xml file and are executed according to the
	corresponding Ant tasks.
	
	You're good to go, you may start writing lambda expressions :-)
